# Dashboard Chart Update - Total Wastes Submitted by All Users

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated Dashboard.js to fetch total waste stats for all users using userAPI.getTotalWasteStats()
- [x] Changed LineChart data from user-specific points trend to app-wide total wastes
- [x] Updated chart title to "Waste Analysis Trend"
- [x] Applied consistent theme colors throughout Dashboard.js using COLORS from theme/colors.js
- [x] Fixed import paths for COLORS in Button.js, Card.js, and StatCard.js components
- [x] Verified backend endpoint /users/total-waste-stats exists and returns correct data format

## Summary
The dashboard now displays a line chart showing the total number of wastes submitted by all users over the last 7 days, instead of the user's individual points trend. The chart title is "Waste Analysis Trend" and all styling uses the eco-green theme colors. Import path issues in shared components have been resolved.
